1. manager class must inherit from CoreObject class.

2. component class must inherit from Component class and also it's respective manager class.

3. every access to a package functionality must be done through package's services module,
   not the manager, even if the caller module is resided inside the same package of that manager,
   the only exception is when the caller in the manager itself.

4. in each package, the business must be implemented inside the manager, not anywhere else, so modules
   like decorators, error_handlers, services, api should not have any business implementation
   but some light weight code that uses the package functionality through services module.

5. every package must subclass Package in it's __init__ module, except application and packaging.
