* all works that belong to same bug or feature must be pushed as a single commit.
  exceptions are described below.

* changes on files that does not belong to main application package (pyrin), or not
  related to code development, like `locale`, `settings`, `docs` and `migrations` must
  be committed separately for each type of files and separated from code changes too.
  this is needed for the peace of mind of developers to reduce the conflict chance and
  other headaches.
   
* all commits must have a well formed english comment as subject that describes what has been
  changed or added. if needed, there could be a body for comment after a blank line.

* follow these rules for every commit message:

    1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
    2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    3. Capitalize the subject line
    4. Do not end the subject line with a period
    5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line which
       fits into (If applied, this commit will <subject>)
    6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
    7. Use the body to explain what and why vs how
