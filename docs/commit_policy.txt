   exceptions are described below.

2. changes on files that does not belong to main application package (pyrin), or not related
   to code development, like `locale` and `settings` and `docs` must be committed separately
   for each type of files and separated from code changes too. this is needed for the peace
   of mind of developers to reduce the conflict chance and other headaches.
   
3. all commits must have a well formed english comment that describes what has been
   changed or added. all comments must be in lowercase except for object types if needed.
